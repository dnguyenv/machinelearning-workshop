# Getting Started with Machine Learning for the Developer

*Industralizing Data Science and Machine Learning*
Machine Learning, and Data Science have been hot topics for the past 10 years, but what does it mean to the *developer*? 
- What where does one get started?
- How do you transform data into insights?
- What does a Machine Learning model look like?
- How do you share the insights of a model with the world?

## Objective
Over the course of the next several hours you will work through 3 open source examples to bring your practical knowlege of machine learning and its applications up to todays best practices.

## Target Audience
- Developers interested in Machine Learning with little or no practical experience with the topic
- Developers that want to have complete code examples to showcase understanding of Machine Learning, and how to integerate insights into applications.
- Developers that are too busy and need to use and apply best practices around Machine Learning today.

## Outcomes
- Identify and describe how Machine Learning is being used in applications today



## Module 1
### _Turn raw data into insights; build, deploy, and consume a Machine Learning Model_

You’re a busy developer, a data scientist or a user with not much coding experience and want the fastest path delivering data insights to users, but this requires deep expertise in many technology domains. This end-to-end use-case driven skill walks you through the technologies used to:

- Acquire, clean, and explore data
- Build a predictive machine learning model
- Make predictions
- Host the model on IBM Cloud for consumption and use
- Integrate the model with your web application

Along the way, you’ll learn about IBM’s Watson Machine Learning Service for hosting your trained model on IBM’s Cloud, and IBM Watson Studio, a Cloud-based IDE for data science teams; tools that bring together many open-source technologies built for data science and machine learning.


*By the end of this Module you should be able to:*

- Visualize and clean data
- Build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook
- Deploy the model to IBM Watson Machine Learning service
- Access the machine learning model through either APIs or a Node.js app
